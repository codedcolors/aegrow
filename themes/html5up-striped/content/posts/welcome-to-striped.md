**Hello!** You're looking at [Striped](http://html5up.net/striped/), a fully responsive HTML5 site template designed by [AJ](http://n33.co/) for [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net/) It features a clean, minimalistic design, styling for all basic page elements (including blockquotes, tables and lists), a repositionable sidebar (left or right), and HTML5/CSS3 code designed for quick and easy customization (see code comments for details).
